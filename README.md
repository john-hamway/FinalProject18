## Game: Fighting Robots

This is a text-based Pokemon-style game where you can play as one of three robots: Striker, Big Boy, or Speedy. You will then need to battle a series of 4 robots and then the final boss, where you beat the game upon beating the final boss.
There are three possible status conditions: off-button (where the robot is inactive for a few turns), burn (where the robot takes 10 hp in burn damage at the end of every turn), and shock (where each move now has a 50% chance of missing).
Each robot has certain stats, such as attack and defense, which vary based on typing. For example, Big Boy is a defender, meaning that his defense stat is above average. The robot's stats, combined with the damage of the selected move, determines how much damage is delt. 
Your chosen robot evolves before the final battle to make it a little easier. 
Your robot's hp is set to full and status is removed at the end of each battle.
It is also possible for moves to miss as each move has a certain % chance that it will not hit.
